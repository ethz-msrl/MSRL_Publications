<h1 class="mt-4">About</h1>

The [Multi Scale Robotics Lab](https://msrl.ethz.ch) (MSRL) is part of the Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems at ETH
Zurich and is headed by Prof. Brad Nelson. The MSRL pursues a dynamic research program
that maintains a strong robotics research focus on several emerging areas of science and technology. A major component
of the MSRL research leverages advanced robotics for creating intelligent machines that operate at micron and nanometer
scales. MSRL research develops the tools and processes required to fabricate and assemble micron sized robots and
nanometer scale robotic components. Many of these systems are used for robotic exploration within biomedical and
biological domains.
