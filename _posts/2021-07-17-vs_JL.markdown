## Abstract ##
Minimally invasive robotic surgery often requires functional tools that canchange their compliance to adapt to the environment and surgical needs. Thispaper proposes a submillimeter continuous variable stiffness catheter equipped with a phase-change alloy that has a high stiffness variation in its different states, allowing for rapid compliance control. Variable stiffness is achieved through a variable phase boundary in the alloy due to a controlledradial temperature gradient. This catheter can be safely navigated in its softstate and rigidiﬁed to the required stiffness during operation to apply a desired force at the tip. The maximal contact force that the catheter applies totissue can be continuously modiﬁed by a factor of 400 (~20 mN–8 N). The catheter is equipped with a magnet and a micro-gripper to perform a fullyrobotic ophthalmic minimally invasive surgery on an eye phantom by meansof an electromagnetic navigation system.
