## Abstract ##
Remote magnetic navigation is used for the manipulation of untethered micro and nanorobots, as well as tethered
magnetic surgical tools for minimally invasive medicine. Mathematical modeling of the magnetic fields generated by magnetic
navigation systems is a fundamental task in the control of such
tools for biomedical applications. We describe and compare
several existing and newly developed methods for representations
of continuous magnetic fields using interpolation in the context
of remote magnetic navigation. Clinical-scale electromagnetic
navigation systems feature nonlinear magnetization and magnetization interactions between electromagnets, which renders
accurate magnetic field modeling challenging. We first introduce
a method that can adapt existing linear models to correct for
nonlinear magnetization, with similar performance to the current
state-of-the-art nonlinear model. Furthermore, we present a
method based on convolutional neural networks that is able to
improve on the state-of-the-art method by a factor of 5.4.
