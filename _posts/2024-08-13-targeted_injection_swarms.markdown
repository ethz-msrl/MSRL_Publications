## Abstract ##
The initial delivery of small-scale magnetic devices such as microrobots is a key, but often overlooked, aspect for their use in clinical applications. The deployment of these devices within the dynamic environment of the human body presents significant challenges due to their dispersion caused by circulatory flows. Here, a method is introduced to effectively deliver a swarm of magnetic nanoparticles in fluidic flows. This approach integrates a magnetically navigated robotic microcatheter equipped with a reservoir for storing the magnetic nanoparticles. The microfluidic flow within the reservoir facilitates the injection of magnetic nanoparticles into the fluid stream, and a magnetic field gradient guides the swarm through the oscillatory flow to a target site. The microcatheter and reservoir are engineered to enable magnetic steering and injection of the magnetic nanoparticles. To demonstrate this approach, experiments are conducted utilizing a spinal cord phantom simulating intrathecal catheter delivery for applications in the central nervous system. These results demonstrate that the proposed microcatheter successfully concentrates nanoparticles near the desired location through the precise manipulation of magnetic field gradients, offering a promising solution for the controlled deployment of untethered magnetic micro-/nanodevices within the complex physiological circulatory systems of the human body.
