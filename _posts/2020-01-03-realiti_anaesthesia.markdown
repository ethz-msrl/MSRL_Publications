## Abstract ##
Robotic endoscope‐automated via laryngeal imaging for tracheal intubation (REALITI) has been developed to enable automated tracheal intubation. This proof‐of‐concept study using a convenience sample of participants, comprised of trained anaesthetists and lay participants with no medical training, assessed the performance of a robotic device for the insertion of a tracheal tube into a manikin. A prototype robotic endoscope device was inserted into the trachea of an airway manikin by seven anaesthetists and seven participants with no medical training. Each individual performed six device insertions into the trachea in manual mode and six in automated mode. The anaesthetists succeeded with 40/42 (95%) manual insertions and 40/42 (95%) automated insertions. The non‐trained participants succeeded in 41/42 (98%) manual insertions and 42/42 (100%) automated insertions. The duration of insertion did not differ between groups. An effect of increasing experience was observed in both groups in manual mode. A Likert scale for ‘ease of use’ (0 = very difficult to 10 = very easy) showed similar results within the two groups; the mean (SD) was 5.9 (2.1) for the anaesthetists and 6.9 (1.3) for the non‐trained participants. We have successfully performed the first automated tracheal device insertion in a manikin with comparable results in a convenience sample of anaesthetists and lay participants with no medical training.

## The REALITI project ##
The REALITI project was carried out at the MSRL between 2018 and 2020 as a collaboration between ETHZ and UZH (University Zurich Hospital). It focused on the design of a robotic endoscope to perform tracheal intubation automatically.

#### January 2020: our paper in IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics is pulished! ####
It covers the design and control of our pre-clinical prototype. The paper is available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8968417).

#### June 2019: presentation at the 2019 Hamlyn Symposium on Medical Robotics ####
We presented the project at the Hamlyn Symposium. The proceedings are available [here](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/393102/2/hamlyn_realiti_final.pdf).

#### June 2018: EMedIC Global 2018 competition ####
The project's team was awarded "The Gold Award for the Overall Achievement" and the "Clinical Readiness Award" at the EMedIC Global 2018 competition.
