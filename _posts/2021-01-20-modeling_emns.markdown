## News ##
* **January 20, 2021**: Our publication was accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics!

## Abstract ##
Remote magnetic navigation is used for the manipulation of untethered micro and nanorobots, as well as tethered
magnetic surgical tools for minimally invasive medicine. Mathematical modeling of the magnetic fields generated by magnetic
navigation systems is a fundamental task in the control of such
tools for biomedical applications. We describe and compare
several existing and newly developed methods for representations
of continuous magnetic fields using interpolation in the context
of remote magnetic navigation. Clinical-scale electromagnetic
navigation systems feature nonlinear magnetization and magnetization interactions between electromagnets, which renders
accurate magnetic field modeling challenging. We first introduce
a method that can adapt existing linear models to correct for
nonlinear magnetization, with similar performance to the current
state-of-the-art nonlinear model. Furthermore, we present a
method based on convolutional neural networks that is able to
improve on the state-of-the-art method by a factor of 5.4.

## Code and Datasets ##
All code and data from this publication is available as open source software.

#### Magnetic Field Interpolation (Section III) ####
* [Magnetic Field Interpolation Code](https://github.com/ethz-msrl/Magnetic_Field_Interpolation) All magnetic field
    interpolation methods were implemented in MATLAB. The project also contains code for evaluating the different
    methods and for generating the figures used in the paper.

* [Dataset](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/408738) The experiments run using a
    pregrenerated synthetic dataset that was generated with the MPEM. These datasets are available for a number of
    random electromagnet currents (Ne=8) and at various grid sizes from 3 to 32. The dataset is stored in HDF5 files.
     Make sure to set the correct path to the dataset files in the load_settings.m
    file.

#### Electromagnet Driven Magnetic Field Models (Section IV) ####
* [CNN and CNN-DF Models](https://github.com/ethz-msrl/deep_fluids/settings) The CNN models are modified from [Deep
    Fluids](https://github.com/byungsook/deep-fluids) from Kim et al and trained using Tensorflow 1.15
* [Code](https://github.com/ethz-msrl/Modeling_eMNS) The code implementing the remaining models and analysis
    is provided as Jupyter notebooks. This also contains the code for exporting the figures used in the paper.
* [Companion Data](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/456493) Data including the training data and pretrained models are
    provided separately at the ETHZ reseach collection.
