biography: "<p>Dr. Minsoo Kim received his undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from Hanyang University in 2012 and his PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Seoul National University in 2018. He worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Soft Robotics Research Center in Seoul National University from September 2018 to August 2020. He joined the MSRL as a postdoctoral researcher in September 2020. <p>Dr. Kim’s research interests include micro-​robotics, actuators/sensors based on functional materials, micro-​/nanoscale fabrications, and manufacturing processes. He demonstrated the world-​first SMA based micro-​mobile robot by using optical energy (UV laser), and the world-​fastest SMA micro-​actuator by using scale effect. He has published over 20 peer-​reviewed journal articles at ACS Nano, Small, Advanced Materials Technologies, CIRP Annals, etc. He has served as a Research Affiliate of CIRP (The International Academy for Production Engineering) since 2019. <p>In 2020, Dr. Kim received a fellowship from the Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (Nurturing Next-​generation Researcher), which was granted by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)."
